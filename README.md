# 漢字連鎖 Kanji/Hanzi Chainer  
  
This is a smartphone app for practicing hand-writing Chinese characters by chaining them by their shared components, based on how I used to furtively practice kanji on a notepad when I worked in a restaurant e.g.:   
  
### 虫 虹 工 紅。寸 吋 囗 吐 土。暑、寒、暖。 

The app supports Japanese, Traditional Chinese, and Simplified Chinese character sets.  
I originally prototyped a [JS/HMTL/CSS webapp](https://github.com/CallumBeaney/rensou-kanji-hinge) version.

# Installation
Download and install the APK file from the [Releases](https://github.com/CallumBeaney/kanji-hanzi-chainer/releases/tag/v1.0.0) section.  
Upon installation the Google ML kit language models will download.  
These cannot be packaged natively [because Google](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/tips/installation-paths#how_to_choose_between_bundled_and_unbundled).  
This will likely take ~10 seconds.  
Thereafter the app is fully operable offline.

# Dictionary information & Acknowledgements
  
I hand-rolled these dictionary files out of a want to not rely on any internet connectivity to use this app.
  
Due to the vastness of their size and technical debt incurred by e.g. the ways that researchers broke characters down into radicals using unicode characters (e.g. 拆 => 扌 手 斥	才), very occasionally characters that should match will not, and characters that one wouldn't intuit to be matchable will be able to be matched. This will be cleared up through regular bugfixing by myself as I use these dictionaries.  

### JAPANESE DICTIONARY STRUCTURE:  
The dictionary follows basic JSON form but is adapted to a Dart object (Map<String, Map<String, nullable String>>).
